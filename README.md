# Apparent-personality-analysis-using-videos
A time distributed deep bimodal approach to predict scores for the Big-5 Personality traits based on videos.


With video conferrencing becoming the new norm, most of our interactions (sometimes including the first) happen through Videos. While personality perception of others is quite subjective, a deep learning approach can be used for a more objective assesment of personality traits. This project uses Videos from the First Impressions Challenge to show one such approach.
